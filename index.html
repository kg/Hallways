          <p>Running.</p>
          <p>Why does this seem so familiar? I've had this dream before, but... more than that, why?</p>
          <p>Am I going in circles? I feel like I'm headed somewhere. It's hard to tell one dimly lit corridor apart from another - they're all tinted the same shade of green.</p>
          <p>Eventually, the hallway opens up into a room with a vaulted ceiling. A staircase on the right winds its way up to a second floor. The glare of moonlight casts deep shadows.</p>
          <p>I normally wake up by now. I suppose I climb the stairs?</p>

            <span class="speech green">Huh.</span>
            I feel like I was in the middle of something. Strange.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clock shows 4 AM, as usual - 5 hours? Could be worse.
            On my way to the bathroom, a glance out the window...

            God <em>DAMN</em> it is cold out here. I should have put on another layer. Or two.
            <span class="speech green">Why can't we just meet in the lobby or something, where it's warm?</span>
            A brief pause and a glare. She really dislikes hypotheticals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="speech red">No smoking inside.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Ah... yeah.</span>
            <span class="speech green">You should consider not killing yourself with those.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">Killing myself with something else is okay?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Well...</span>
            Wait, was she serious?
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">Asshole.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean it.</span>
            Please stop staring at me. Jesus. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Good. Looks like she has something to say.
            <span class="speech red">So, what was it tonight?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="internal">Shit.</span>
            <span class="speech green">It's pretty fuzzy for some reason. I think I was falling?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">Again? You had that dream last night.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Yeah, think so. I wake up before I hit the ground, so I can't complain.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">It's from that grim shit you write. You'd sleep better if you stuck to heartwarming coming-of-age stories about a young boy and his race h-</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Anything but that!</span>
            <span class="internal">Anything. Ugh.</span>
            <span class="speech green">I really want to finish this one. It's been bouncing around inside my skull ever since I got the idea, so I need to do something with it. It might be something special.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">Mmm.</span>
            She might be humoring me, but that seemed like genuine agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">So, what about you?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">Drowning.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Shit, again? I'm sorry. That one sounded awful.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">... do you need to talk about it?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">I... yeah. If you don't mind?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Of course not.</span>
            It's amazing how vivid her nightmares are. The drowning one is by far the worst.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">So... it's always dark, and it's cold. I hear the sound of... wind rushing past my ears? But I'm underwater.</span>
            <span class="speech red">This time it was warm. That should be better, but I think it was worse.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Hm.
            <span class="speech green">That's odd. Maybe you're not in the ocean?</span>
            But where, then?
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech red">Hm... Some kind of hot spring? That would be warm at night.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="speech green">Oh! That could be it. Maybe the rushing wind is gas rising past you?</span>
            Ah, I'm getting into this. Need to conceal my interest... might seem like I'm not taking her seriously.
          </p>

          <p>
            She seems bothered by this for some reason. A deep sigh.
            <span class="speech red">It probably doesn't mean anything. I have no idea why I'd dream about a hot spring.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Wait, why is that the first question that comes to mind?
            <span class="speech green">... drowning, though? There's a reason you'd dream about that?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            She's upset. I shouldn't have asked that.
            <span class="speech red">I'm going back. Later.</span>
            Doesn't even extinguish her cigarette. I guess the odds of a fire starting are low in this weather.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shit.
            <span class="speech green">Yeah... you too. Hope you get some sleep.</span>

  The comparative warmth of my apartment makes me feel like I could curl up in bed and fall back asleep immediately. That dream, though... I still feel uneasy. Is it just because I can't remember it? I usually remember these things perfectly, but no matter how many times I have this one...

  Come to think of it, my dreams don't usually repeat. Maybe just the stress of the deadline coming up. Well, if I'm not going to sleep, I should try to get some writing done.

  The problem with this story - I just can't pin down the conflict. I've got characters, and I'm absolutely in love with the idea, but I can't figure out what - or who - is actually threatening them. It bothers me because I don't usually write this way, but all I've got are scattered images, thoughts and feelings loosely connected. I have to figure out how to stitch all this together into something coherent. Make it work somehow. An idea like this deserves it. If I did a shitty job on this, I'm not sure I could face her.

  Maybe it's not a horror story? That's no good, though - some second-rate thriller novelist decides to write a romance? Nobody's going to publish that. They'd probably recall my last book and burn it as a symbolic gesture.

  Well, I can always warm up by writing something else. Once I'm in the mood I might be able to make some headway on this damn novel.

            <span class="internal">At least it's not snowing.</span>
            <span class="speech green">We should try texting or instant messages or something.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
  <span class="speech red">I'd be smoking out here by myself, trying to use a phone keyboard with gloves on.</span>
  <span class="internal">Foiled again.</span>
  <span class="speech red">Any progress today? I know that deadline's approaching.</span>

  Don't remind me.
  <span class="speech ">It took a while to get in the mood, but I managed to write a dozen pages or so.</span>

  <span class="speech ">Will they come back from the editor covered in red ink?</span>
  You know me too well.
  <span class="speech ">They always do, so I try not to worry. Serenity to accept the things you can't change, you know?</span>

  A bemused smile.
  <span class="speech ">Serenity... not the word that comes to mind when I think of you.</span>

  <span class="speech ">Oooh. What word <em>does</em> come to mind? Is it suitable for general audiences? Perhaps it's... 'ravishing'?</span>

  <span class="speech ">Writers and your fucking thesauruses.</span>
  Actually, is the word thesaurus plural? I need to look that up.
  <span class="speech ">I'm not telling you. Your ego's big enough as-is.</span>

  An obvious response comes to mind. She knocked the wind right out of me last time, though, so I'll hold onto it. Just gonna let this conversation thread drop...


  <span class="speech ">And this time?</span>

  She pauses for a bit longer than usual, like she's deciding whether to tell me. That usually means...
  <span class="speech ">Hallways.</span>
  Yeah.

  <span class="speech ">Different this time?</span>

  <span class="speech ">A little.</span>

  <span class="speech ">I suppose that's a small blessing. Seems like it'd be easier to fall asleep, even if it wakes you up.</span>

  <span class="speech ">Sort of. It's not scary, but it's...</span>
  <span class="speech ">Unsettling?</span>

  Hm?
  <span class="speech ">What do you mean?</span>

  <span class="speech ">You know when you suddenly feel like you've forgotten something?</span>
  <span class="speech ">The thing you forgot happened just a moment ago, and it was important.</span>

  Sounds familiar.
  <span class="speech ">Ah, I get it. That must be frustrating.</span>

  <span class="speech ">If you want, you can tell me about it? I'm happy to listen, and you might remember that important thing.</span>
  She smiles at me. Don't see that very often. 

  <span class="speech ">Are you sure?</span>
  There's something odd about that look on her face...
  <span class="speech ">I keep thinking about what you said the other day.</span>
  What is this? She's usually reluctant, but...
  <span class="speech ">If writing a dream down gives it power over us... should I be telling you?</span>
  ... why is she still smiling?
  <span class="speech ">It's bad enough that we wake up every night. I don't want to make things worse.</span>

  I can look forward to many restless nights if I miss this deadline.
  <span class="speech ">It's fine, really. Words alone aren't that powerful.</span>
  <span class="speech ">They leave our heads as easily as they enter, you know? It's just that act... committing it to paper with your own hands, the words flow through you, right?</span>

  I don't know if she's buying it.
  <span class="speech ">I sleep better now that we talk like this. It's easier to forget these things if you tell someone about them, I think. You're casting them out of your head, and they can just float away.</span>

  Ah, that did it.
  <span class="speech ">... yeah. I sleep better now, too.</span>

  <span class="speech ">I'm climbing across these... scaffolds? Twisted pieces of brass, running along the walls.</span>
  <span class="speech ">I can just barely see inside, but everything is tinted a dull green - I guess the walls are glass.</span>
  It is different. But I can't put my finger on it...

  <span class="speech ">I'm just desperate to get inside, like someone important is waiting for me.</span>

  Wait.
  <span class="speech ">Someone important?</span>

  <span class="speech ">... yeah, definitely a person.</span>

  <span class="speech ">A balcony is up ahead. I make my way over and climb down onto it.</span>
  <span class="speech ">The door is open... maybe I came out through it?</span>
  ... came out?
  <span class="speech ">Once I enter, it's just hallways.</span>
  She was inside before?
  <span class="speech ">I run, without hesitation. I pass straight through the intersections.</span>
  Has she mentioned being inside before the scaffolds?
  <span class="speech ">I know where I'm headed. Doors line the hallway, but they're locked.</span>

  I need to check my notes...
  <span class="speech ">You try opening them?</span>

  <span class="speech ">They're locked. No point.</span>
  That look she's giving me... like I should know this? I'm getting a headache.
  <span class="speech ">The cold's getting to you, isn't it? I'm done with my cigarette anyway.</span>

  <span class="speech ">Yeah... I could use a cup of tea right about now. Sleep well, okay?</span>

  Another smile.
  <span class="speech ">I will.</span>

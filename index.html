          <p>Why does this seem so familiar? I've had this dream before, but... more than that, why?</p>

          <p>Am I going in circles? I feel like I'm headed somewhere. It's hard to tell one dimly lit corridor apart from another - they're all tinted the same shade of green.</p>
          <p>Eventually, the hallway opens up into a room with a vaulted ceiling. A staircase on the right winds its way up to a second floor. The glare of moonlight casts deep shadows.</p>

          <p>I normally wake up by now. I suppose I climb the stairs?</p>

            I feel like I was in the middle of something. Strange.
            The clock shows 4 AM, as usual - 5 hours? Could be worse.

          God <em>DAMN</em> it is cold out here. I should have put on another layer. Or two.
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Why can't we just meet in the lobby or something, where it's warm?</span>
          A brief pause and a glare. She really dislikes hypotheticals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">No smoking inside.</span>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Ah... yeah.</span>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">You should consider not killing yourself with those.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">Killing myself with something else is okay?</span>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Well...</span>
          Wait, was she serious?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">Asshole.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean it.</span>
          Please stop staring at me. Jesus. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Good. Looks like she has something to say.
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">So, what was it tonight?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Shit.
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">It's pretty fuzzy for some reason. I think I was falling?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">Again? You had that dream last night.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Yeah, think so. I wake up before I hit the ground, so I can't complain.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in" data-advanceDelay="-10">It's from that grim shit you write. You'd sleep better if you stuck to heartwarming coming-of-age stories about a young boy and his race h-</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Anything but that!</span>
          Anything. Ugh.
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">I really want to finish this one. It's been bouncing around inside my skull ever since I got the idea, so I need to do something with it. It might be something special.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">Mmm.</span>
          She might be humoring me, but that seemed like genuine agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">So, what about you?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">Drowning.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Shit, again? I'm sorry. That one sounded awful.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">... do you need to talk about it?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">I... yeah. If you don't mind?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Of course not.</span>
          It's amazing how vivid her nightmares are. The drowning one is by far the worst.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">So... it's always dark, and it's cold. I hear the sound of... wind rushing past my ears? But I'm underwater.</span>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">This time it was warm. That should be better, but I think it was worse.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Hm.
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">That's odd. Maybe you're not in the ocean?</span>
          But where, then?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">Hm... Some kind of hot spring? That would be warm at night.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Oh! That could be it. Maybe the rushing wind is gas rising past you?</span>
          Ah, I'm getting into this. Need to conceal my interest... might seem like I'm not taking her seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
          She seems bothered by this for some reason. A deep sigh.
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">It probably doesn't mean anything. I have no idea why I'd dream about a hot spring.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Wait, why is that the first question that comes to mind?
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">... drowning, though? There's a reason you'd dream about that?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          She's upset. I shouldn't have asked that.
          <span class="speech red" data-animationName="rise-fade-in">I'm going back. Later.</span>
          Doesn't even extinguish her cigarette. I guess the odds of a fire starting are low in this weather.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shit.
          <span class="speech green" data-animationName="drop-in-fade">Yeah... you too. Hope you get some sleep.</span>

The comparative warmth of my apartment makes me feel like I could curl up in bed and fall back asleep immediately. That dream, though... I still feel uneasy. Is it just because I can't remember it? I usually remember these things perfectly, but no matter how many times I have this one...

Come to think of it, my dreams don't usually repeat. Maybe just the stress of the deadline coming up. Well, if I'm not going to sleep, I should try to get some writing done.

The problem with this story - I just can't pin down the conflict. I've got characters, and I'm absolutely in love with the idea, but I can't figure out what - or who - is actually threatening them. It bothers me because I don't usually write this way, but all I've got are scattered images, thoughts and feelings loosely connected. I have to figure out how to stitch all this together into something coherent. Make it work somehow. An idea like this deserves it. If I did a shitty job on this, I'm not sure I could face her.

Maybe it's not a horror story? That's no good, though - some second-rate thriller novelist decides to write a romance? Nobody's going to publish that. They'd probably recall my last book and burn it as a symbolic gesture.

Well, I can always warm up by writing something else. Once I'm in the mood I might be able to make some headway on this damn novel.
